# Ronak's Portfolio
This portfolio is a static website created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website showcases my work, skills and contact information.

##How to run
To run this portfolio, you can simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Alternatively, you can host the website on a web server.

##Features
- A section showcasing my work with cards that move on hover.
- A section with a contact form where users can submit their name, email and a message.
 
##Hiding the navbar on scroll
The portfolio website includes a feature to hide the navigation bar on scroll, which was implemented using JavaScript. I followed this [educative article](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-hide-the-navbar-on-scroll-on-a-webpage) for guidance on implementing this feature.
