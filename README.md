# Ronak's Portfolio
This portfolio is a static website created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website showcases my work, courses and contact information.

## How to run
This Vercel link will run in any web browser. You can simply run the index.html file. 

## Features
- A section showcasing my work with cards that move on hover.
- A section with a contact form where users can submit their name, email and a message. Output will be logged in the console.
 
## Hiding the navbar on scroll
The portfolio website includes a feature to hide the navigation bar on scroll, which was implemented using JavaScript. I followed this [educative article](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-hide-the-navbar-on-scroll-on-a-webpage) for guidance on implementing this feature.
