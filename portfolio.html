      <p>
        Welcome! I am a software engineer currently studying Computer
        Science and Physics at Portland State University. I am a
        creative problem solver with a passion for design and
        technology. My love for technology began at a young age, where
        I would spend hours tinkering with computers and software,
        trying to figure out how they worked. As I grew older, I
        realized that my passion for technology went hand in hand with
        my love for design.

        <br /><br />

        Over the years, I've gained experience in all aspects of the
        software development process, from ideation and prototyping to
        testing and deployment. I have a keen eye for detail and
        strive to create software that is not only functional but also
        aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.

        <br /><br />

        On my page, you'll find a selection of projects that showcase
        my skills and experience in software. From web development to
        user interface design to data analysis, I'm always pushing
        myself to create work that is both innovative and
        user-friendly. I'm excited to share my portfolio with you and
        look forward to connecting with others who share my passion
        for technology and design!
