      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome! I am a software engineer currently studying Computer
        Science and Physics at Portland State University. I am a
        creative problem solver with a passion for design and
        technology. My love for technology began at a young age, where
        I would spend hours tinkering with computers and software,
        trying to figure out how they worked. As I grew older, I
        realized that my passion for technology went hand in hand with
        my love for design.

        <br /><br />

        Over the years, I've gained experience in all aspects of the
        software development process, from ideation and prototyping to
        testing and deployment. I have a keen eye for detail and
        strive to create software that is not only functional but also
        aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.

        <br /><br />

        On my page, you'll find a selection of projects that showcase
        my skills and experience in software. From web development to
        user interface design to data analysis, I'm always pushing
        myself to create work that is both innovative and
        user-friendly. I'm excited to share my portfolio with you and
        look forward to connecting with others who share my passion
        for technology and design!

          <h3>Project 01: PySnake</h3>
          <p>
            This Snake game was built using Pygame and follows an
            object-oriented approach, featuring classes for the snake,
            food, and game logic. The classic arcade-style game
            involves controlling a growing snake on a board while
            avoiding obstacles and edges. Building this project
            improved my skills in Python, OOP, and game development,
            teaching me to design classes and methods, manage graphics
            and display updates, handle events and game states, and
            write efficient code.

          <h3>Project 02: Color Cluster</h3>
          <p>
            ColorCluster is a Python tool I built that extracts the
            dominant colors from an image and presents them as a color
            palette. The tool was built using OpenCV and Scikit-learn
            libraries to cluster pixels and sort them by frequency.
            This project was a great way for me to learn about image
            processing and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. I
            also learned how to work with OpenCV and NumPy, and how to
            apply KMeans clustering to pixel data.

          <h3>Project 03: Blender</h3>
          <p>
            Blender.Co is an innovative blockchain platform designed
            to provide users with a secure and confidential way to
            calculate their crypto credit score. Built with a
            user-friendly interface and interactive app, Blender.Co
            assesses a user's creditworthiness based on multiple
            factors and delivers the results quickly and efficiently.
            This project taught me how to design and develop a user
            interface that is simple to navigate and intuitive to use.
